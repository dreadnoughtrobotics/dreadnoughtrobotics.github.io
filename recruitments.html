          <div class="panel">
            <p>A special team at VIT is a unique opportunity for students to pursue their passion for a particular
              subject while learning and growing in a team environment. These teams are entirely student-funded and
              formed by a group of dedicated individuals who are eager to explore their field of interest. By joining a
              special team, students can participate in inter-college, national, and even international competitions,
              allowing them to showcase their skills and compete with like-minded individuals.<Br><Br>
              <b>VIT has 12 special teams, which adds to the exclusivity of being part of one.</b> Being part of a
              special team is an enriching experience that provides students with a chance to immerse themselves in a
              community of like-minded individuals who are equally passionate about the same subject. Each team has a
              specific area of focus and provides students with opportunities to develop a range of skills, including
              leadership, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.<br><br>
              Furthermore, being part of a special team also provides a unique perspective on the subject that the team
              specializes in, allowing students to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for it. Students are
              allowed to join only one special team, which ensures that they can dedicate their full attention and
              energy towards the team's goals and objectives.

          <button class="accordion"><strong>Who are applicable for the recruitments open now?</strong></button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              To ensure that <b>freshers and 2nd-year students</b> can experience and contribute to the vibrant
              extracurricular culture at VIT, we have decided to open special team applications to these students ONLY.
              Freshers and 2nd years are still in the early stages of their college journey and have a lot to learn and
              experience. By giving them the chance to participate in a special team, we hope to facilitate their growth
              and development both academically and personally. <Br><br>
              Also, to ensure that each student can dedicate their full attention and energy towards their chosen
              special team, no student is allowed to be part of multiple special teams.<Br><Br>
              Additionally, <b>if a member decides to quit a team for whatever reason, he/she will not be permitted to
                be a part of ANY other special team for the remainder of their academic years at VIT Chennai.</b>

              Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) capable of accomplishing challenging tasks within a stipulated time
              frame. Our team is dedicated to designing and building an AUV that can navigate through underwater
              obstacles, accurately identify, and locate targets, and perform a range of complex operations. In addition
              to the SAUVC, we also actively participate in various inter-college competitions, including the
              prestigious IIT Bombay Techfest.<Br><br>
              Moreover, we are excited to announce that our team has been selected to participate in the TAC AUV
              Challenge scheduled to be held Norway in June 2023. The TAC AUV Challenge is a highly competitive event
              that brings together the best AUV teams from across the globe to compete in a series of challenging
              underwater tasks. Our team is geared up to take on this challenge and make a mark in the world of
              autonomous underwater robotics.
